# SAMP-MapDrawer2D
Draws a 2D Map of the World using ColAndreas

Load as Filterscript to begin drawing a BMP File.

You can configure resolution, World Bounds, Colors and more in the script.

If your Script does not already use ColAndreas for your maps, set the *GRAB_OBJECTS* define to *true* to grab all Streamer Objects from the specified virtual world and temporarily create them as Collision Objects.

# OC.inc

This Include contains an Array for all Model Categories (including SAMP Objects).
The FS uses it to draw colors based on them.

# farray.inc

FArray offers an Array-like file system to buffer lots of data somewhere else than the stack or header.
They are slower, but they offer theoretically unlimited space which can be (de)allocated at any time.

__Note:__ Create a folder called *fa* inside your *scriptfiles* directory.

# Example

This is a Map generated by this Script, colors are based on Categories (Roads are Red, Railroads are Blue) and the steepness of the terrain.
